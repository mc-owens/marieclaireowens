        <p>I dance to bring sense into my life. I dance to connect. I dance to share love and joy with others. I dance to learn and experience. My choreography is rooted in intentionality and narration â€” whether it is abstract themes, imaginative, or personal experience. Clarity and precision are integral qualities that guide every movement taken with purpose. Angulation and articulation through the joints combined with stabs, spokes, angels, and swipes make up my own personal movement style. Geometrical figures and shapes inspire the juxtaposition in angles and curves. Musicality drives dynamic movements of  sharpness, suspension, and shape. </p>
        <p>What inspires me is the human experience. Someone, somewhere has felt what another human has felt before, even if they are thousands of miles away from each other. Emotions are emotions regardless of any other factor. Regardless of graceful lines or quirky movement, my choreographic process stems from a place of combining the mind, body, and emotional soul. Stemming from either improv or a step by step narrative, the unfolding of the story happens through use of motif. I believe in the power of simplicity as long as the movement is intentful and purposeful. I want to leave viewers with their own emotional response whether they understand all the minutiae of the movement or create their own narrative in their minds. The road to perfection does not exist but luckily there are an infinite amount of roads that lead to art. </p>
